Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation.

RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, then using those documents as context for generating responses. This approach helps ground the generation in factual information and reduces hallucinations.

The RAG process typically involves:
1. Embedding documents into a vector space
2. Indexing the embeddings for fast retrieval
3. Retrieving relevant documents for a given query
4. Passing the retrieved context to a language model
5. Generating a response based on the context

RAG is particularly useful for question-answering systems, chatbots, and any application where factual accuracy is important.
