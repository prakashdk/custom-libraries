# Example Document 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error

Machine learning applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision.
