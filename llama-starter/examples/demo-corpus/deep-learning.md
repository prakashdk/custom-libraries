# Example Document 2: Deep Learning Basics

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

## Applications

- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Drug discovery

Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in various fields, often exceeding human-level performance on specific tasks.
