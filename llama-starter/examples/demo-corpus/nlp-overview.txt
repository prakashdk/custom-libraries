Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

Common NLP tasks include:
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition
- Machine translation
- Question answering
- Text summarization

Modern NLP heavily relies on deep learning techniques, particularly transformer models like BERT and GPT, which have revolutionized the field in recent years.
